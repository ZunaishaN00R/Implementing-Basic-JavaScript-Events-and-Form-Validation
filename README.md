## Lab Task: Implementing Basic JavaScript Events and Form Validation

### Objective
The objective of this lab task is to enhance skills in handling user interactions on a web page by implementing basic JavaScript events and form validation.

### HTML Structure
- Create an HTML file containing a form with the following fields:
  - Name (text input)
  - Email (email input)
  - Password (password input)
  - Confirm Password (password input)
  - Submit Button

### CSS Styling
- Apply basic CSS styling to make the form visually appealing.
- Style the form elements, labels, and error messages.

### JavaScript Events and Validation
- **Name Validation:**
  - Implement an event handler for the name input.
  - Check if the name contains only letters and spaces.
  - Display an error message near the name field if the input is invalid.
  
- **Email Validation:**
  - Implement an event handler for the email input.
  - Check if the input is a valid email address using a regular expression.
  - Display an error message near the email field if the input is invalid.
  
- **Password Matching:**
  - Implement event handlers for the password and confirm password inputs.
  - Check if the passwords match.
  - Display an error message near the confirm password field if the passwords do not match.

- **Form Submission:**
  - Implement a function to handle the form submission when the user clicks the submit button.
  - Validate all fields.
  - If any fields are invalid, prevent the form submission and display appropriate error messages.
  - If all fields are valid, display an alert saying "Form submitted successfully."

### Description
This lab task involves creating an interactive registration form where users can input their name, email, password, and confirm password. JavaScript event handlers are implemented to validate user inputs in real-time and provide feedback to the user through error messages. Upon submission, the form is validated again, and if all inputs are valid, an alert confirming successful form submission is displayed. The HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic work together to create a seamless user experience.
